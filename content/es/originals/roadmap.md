# Roadmap

Where Soundsible is going and why. This is the user-facing plan; the documents
under "internals" are working notes and may be stale or abandoned.

Nothing here has a date. Items ship when they are ready, in roughly the order
below, because each one depends on the one before it.

## What Soundsible is

Most self-hosted music tools solved *serving* music and never solved *getting*
it. Navidrome is excellent at playing a library you already have. Lidarr fetches
whole albums. Between "I heard this track" and "it is in my library, tagged, on
every device" there is a gap that people still cross with several tools.

Soundsible closes that gap:

> **discover → acquire the track → land it tagged in your library → play it
> anywhere.**

Search reaches your library, Deezer, MusicBrainz and YouTube at once and returns
one ranked list. Saving something resolves it, scores the match, downloads it,
tags it and adds it. [Auto Mode](AUTO_MODE.md) then plays it as an editable,
analysis-driven DJ set rather than a shuffled queue.

## Where it is going

### Serve any client, not just ours

Soundsible has its own responsive player, desktop beta, and native iOS client.
It also speaks the **OpenSubsonic API**, so Symfonium, Feishin, DSub, Amperfy,
Tempo, play:Sub and the rest can use the same library — including their offline,
Android Auto, CarPlay, and watch surfaces where supported.

That needs a real library schema first: first-class album and artist tables,
disc numbers, compilations, multiple artists per track, play counts, ratings and
last-played. And SQLite as the source of truth rather than an index rebuilt from
JSON.

- [x] Library schema: albums, artists, disc numbers, compilations, play counts, ratings
- [x] SQLite canonical; `library.json` becomes an export format
- [x] `POST /api/library/scan` — point Soundsible at a folder you already have
- [ ] Read ReplayGain / R128 tags when a file carries them
- [x] Write MusicBrainz IDs on acquisition
- [x] Decide artist/title orientation by lookup, not by position. A YouTube
      title is split on the first separator and the left side is taken as the
      artist, unverified. Uploads titled "Song - Artist" therefore land
      reversed, which files the track under the wrong name and makes it
      unfindable. The providers that could settle it — Deezer, MusicBrainz —
      are already wired in for search, and `shared/resolution_confidence.py`
      already scores a pair.
- [x] OpenSubsonic API with on-the-fly transcoding — see [OpenSubsonic](OPENSUBSONIC.md)
- [x] Album, genre and year browsing in the player

### Join the open music web

- [ ] Scrobbling to ListenBrainz, Last.fm and Maloja
- [ ] ListenBrainz as a recommendation input alongside local signals
- [ ] Artist biographies and images from MusicBrainz / Wikidata
- [ ] Smart playlists over play counts, ratings, year, genre and BPM
- [ ] M3U and OPML import / export

### Make acquisition durable

The catalog depends on yt-dlp working against YouTube, and YouTube changes.

- [ ] yt-dlp updates itself in the container
- [ ] A scheduled CI canary that fails loudly when extraction breaks
- [ ] A pluggable source layer, so YouTube is one provider and not an assumption

### Sharpen what is already unique

- [x] Auto Mode documented as the product's two-deck, editable DJ workflow
- [ ] Auto Mode out of beta
- [ ] Live becomes explicitly opt-in, with self-hosting the relay documented
- [ ] Federated Live relays

## Deliberately not planned

- **Video.** Soundsible is a music server. Use Jellyfin.
- **Browsing by folder structure.** Metadata is the organising principle.
- **Being a general-purpose downloader.** Acquisition serves the library.
- **A hosted service.** You run it. That is the whole point.
