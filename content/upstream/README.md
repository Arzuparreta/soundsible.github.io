## What is Soundsible?

Soundsible is a music service you run on your **own** machine. It searches far
beyond the files you already have, turns a find into a properly tagged library
track, and can mix the result into a continuous set with its built-in **Auto DJ**.
YouTube, YouTube Music, podcasts, your existing collection, recommendations,
lyrics, Live broadcasting, and every playback surface live in one player. No
ads, no tracking, no subscription.

Most self-hosted music servers begin after you have found, downloaded, and
organized the music. Soundsible handles that missing journey:

> **discover → listen now → acquire and tag → keep in your library → Auto DJ the set → play anywhere**

| Source | What it gives you |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **YouTube** | A practically unlimited catalog |
| **YouTube Music** | Music search and playable matches |
| **iTunes Podcasts** | Podcasts in the same player |
| **Deezer** | Charts, discovery & clean metadata *(metadata only — no audio)* |

**What you get**

- 🎛️ **Auto Mode (beta) — a DJ, not a shuffle button** — a two-deck mixer analyses
  tempo, key, energy, structure, and cue points; then beatmatches and chooses
  blends, bass swaps, filter transitions, cuts, or safe fades. Pick the music,
  steer the direction, edit the route, or let the DJ run.
- 🌍 **A huge catalog that becomes your library** — search your collection,
  Deezer, MusicBrainz, and YouTube together; preview a result immediately, then
  let Soundsible resolve, download, tag, and file the track.
- 🧠 **Personal discovery without surrendering your profile** — recommendations,
  Autoplay, and endless Radio learn from listening history held on your server.
- 📻 **Broadcast the whole program live** — share the actual two-deck output,
  including Auto Mode transitions and effects, through a browser listening room.
- 📱 **One polished player everywhere** — web, PWA, desktop beta, native iOS,
  car controls, and OpenSubsonic clients all connect to the same library.
- 🔐 **Private by design** — self-hosted and multi-user, with no ads, tracking,
  subscription, or cloud listening profile.

### Soundsible or Navidrome?

[Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/docs/overview/) is a mature, lightweight
choice for serving a large, carefully prepared music collection. Soundsible is
for the other question: **what if the self-hosted service also helped you find,
acquire, understand, mix, and share the music?**

| | A library server such as Navidrome | Soundsible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Music you do not own yet** | Bring a file to the server first | Search YouTube/YouTube Music alongside your library, preview it, then acquire it from the player |
| **From result to library** | An external downloader and tagging workflow | Resolve the best match, download, tag with catalog metadata, and add it to the library in one flow |
| **Automatic listening** | Shuffle, smart playlists, or radio over the collection | Local recommendations, Autoplay, endless Radio, plus Auto Mode's editable DJ route |
| **Transitions** | Normal player handoff or configurable client behavior | A two-deck engine with analysis-driven cueing, beatmatching, EQ/filter blends, cuts, fades, and loudness levelling |
| **Going live** | Share files or public links | Broadcast the program output and its transitions to a browser room with chat |
| **Spoken requests and automation** | General API/client ecosystem | A scoped agent API that can search, queue, play, and target a specific device |
| **What both do well** | Self-hosting, multi-user libraries, metadata, playlists, web playback, and Subsonic clients | The same foundations, with acquisition and creation built on top |

This is not a claim that Soundsible is a drop-in replacement for every mature
Navidrome feature. It is a different product boundary. If your library is
already perfect and you only want to serve it with very low resource use,
Navidrome may be the better fit. If you want the path from discovery to a mixed,
owned, private collection inside one app, that is the reason Soundsible exists.

See [Auto Mode](docs/AUTO_MODE.md) for the DJ workflow and
[Moving from Spotify or Apple Music](docs/MUSIC_MIGRATION.md) for bringing an
existing music profile across.

## Install

Choose one installation path:

- **Native installation** — run directly on Linux, macOS, or Windows, with full
  access to the launcher and the local development workflow. This is the
  primary installation method and the one the maintainer runs and maintains.
- **Docker** — one command, nothing to compile, and the practical option on a
  NAS or a Raspberry Pi. Supported, but not the primary path.
- **Desktop app (beta)** — a one-click app for Linux and Windows with no
  terminal, for a single machine rather than a server.

### Native installation

Native installs require **Python 3.10+**, **git**, **FFmpeg**, and **Node.js
22+**. Node is used for the one-time SolidJS player build; the production
bundle is not committed to the repo. **Desktop beta** installers bundle the
player, so they skip the Node.js build step.

#### Pick your OS

<details>
<summary><b>🐧 &nbsp; Linux</b></summary>
<br>

```bash
# 1. Install prerequisites (Debian / Ubuntu)
sudo apt install -y git ffmpeg python3 python3-venv python3-pip nodejs npm

# 2. Get Soundsible
git clone https://github.com/Arzuparreta/soundsible.git
cd soundsible

# 3. Install web player deps (one-time; dist builds on engine start)
cd ui_web && npm ci && cd ..
# or force a rebuild anytime: python3 scripts/ensure_ui_dist.py --force

# 4. Run it
python3 run.py
```

**Other distros** — swap step 1:

- **Arch:** `sudo pacman -S git ffmpeg python python-pip nodejs npm`
- **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install git ffmpeg python3 python3-pip nodejs npm`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🍎 &nbsp; macOS</b></summary>
<br>

Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```bash
# 1. Install prerequisites
brew install git ffmpeg python node

# 2. Get Soundsible
git clone https://github.com/Arzuparreta/soundsible.git
cd soundsible

# 3. Install web player deps (one-time; dist builds on engine start)
cd ui_web && npm ci && cd ..
# or force a rebuild anytime: python3 scripts/ensure_ui_dist.py --force

# 4. Run it
python3 run.py
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🪟 &nbsp; Windows</b></summary>
<br>

In **PowerShell**:

```powershell
# 1. Install prerequisites
winget install Git.Git Python.Python.3.12 Gyan.FFmpeg OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# 2. Close and reopen PowerShell so the new tools are on PATH, then:
git clone https://github.com/Arzuparreta/soundsible.git
cd soundsible

# 3. Install web player deps (one-time; dist builds on engine start)
cd ui_web; npm ci; cd ..

# 4. Run it
python run.py
```
No `winget`? Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick *"Add to PATH"*), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS), and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) manually.

</details>

#### First native run

The first `python3 run.py` creates the project virtualenv, installs Python dependencies, and — if you have not configured storage yet — starts the **setup wizard** at **<http://localhost:5099/setup>** (no terminal menu yet). Complete setup in the browser, then click **Launch** on the launcher page to start the engine.

On later runs you get a terminal menu. Start listening with:

```bash
python3 run.py          # choose "Start Station Engine & Open Station"
```

That starts the engine and opens **<http://localhost:5005/player/>**. Keep the terminal open while you play; closing it stops the engine.

### Docker

Published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, with FFmpeg, Chromaprint, Python
and the compiled web player already inside:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arzuparreta/soundsible/main/compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

Wait for `soundsible` to report `healthy`, then open
**<http://localhost:5005/player/>**. The first start creates a local-storage
configuration by itself. Configuration, application data, cache, logs, and
downloaded music live in separate named volumes and survive image or container
replacement.

```bash
docker compose logs -f soundsible # follow startup/runtime logs
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d   # upgrade
docker compose down               # stop without deleting your library
```

`:edge` tracks `main`; `:latest` and `:X.Y.Z` track releases. See
[Docker deployment](docs/DOCKER.md) for host-library mounts, `.env`
configuration, provenance verification, security, backups, and building from
source instead.

### Web player

The Station is one responsive **SolidJS** app served by the engine:

| URL | Use |
| --- | --- |
| **<http://localhost:5005/player/>** | Browsers, phones, PWAs — the default player |
| **<http://localhost:5005/player/desktop/>** | Same UI with owner-token bootstrap for the desktop shell |

Legacy paths (`/player/app.html`, `/player/mobile/`, …) redirect to `/player/`.

**Frontend development** — with the engine on port 5005, run `npm run dev` in `ui_web/` and open **<http://localhost:5173/player/>** (Vite proxies API and Socket.IO). See [ui_web/README.md](ui_web/README.md).

> 💡 Prefer a browser control panel over the terminal menu? Run `./venv/bin/python start_launcher.py`, open **<http://localhost:5099>**, and click **Launch**. Setup-only: `python3 run.py --setup`.

### Listen everywhere

- **On your phone (PWA)** — open the player on your phone, then *Share → Add to Home Screen* (iOS) or *Menu → Install app* (Android).
- **iPhone and iPad (native app)** — the PWA stops playing when Safari goes to
  the background, which on a phone is most of the time. The native app keeps
  playing with the screen locked, downloads music for offline listening, and
  shows title, artwork and working controls on a car's screen. It is not on the
  App Store; it installs through [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) and needs iOS
  26 or newer. See
  [iOS](docs/IOS.md).
- **From anywhere** — publish the station with `tailscale serve --bg --yes --https=443 5005`
  and open the HTTPS `.ts.net/player/` URL it prints. HTTPS also enables Live
  broadcasting from remote browsers. Already publishing something else from that
  machine? Pick another port — see
  [sharing the node](docs/INSTALL.md#sharing-the-node-with-other-services).
- **In any Subsonic app** — Soundsible speaks the OpenSubsonic API, so
  Symfonium, Amperfy, Feishin, DSub, Tempo and play:Sub play your library as
  it is, offline copies and car screens included. Generate a password in
  *Settings → Other clients* and point the app at your server. See
  [OpenSubsonic](docs/OPENSUBSONIC.md).
- **Servers, reverse proxies, security** — see the [Install & Deployment guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

> 🖥️ **Desktop app (beta)** — a one-click Tauri app with no terminal is available for early testers. Install from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Arzuparreta/soundsible/releases) — every release carries the installers alongside the server images — or build locally — see [docs/DESKTOP_BETA.md](docs/DESKTOP_BETA.md).
