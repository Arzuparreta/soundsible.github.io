# Soundsible Agent Integration Guide

This guide is for OpenClaw, Hermes agents, local assistants, and agent skills that need to control a running Soundsible Station Engine.

Soundsible is not a cloud music API. It is a self-hosted Station Engine, usually at:

```text
http://localhost:5005
```

On LAN or Tailscale, replace `localhost` with the Station host IP or hostname.

In desktop-engine mode, the base URL is not assumed to be `:5005`. Read the readiness JSON emitted by `python3 run.py --desktop-engine` / `soundsible_engine.py`, or query `/api/health` from the known loopback URL and use its reported `base_url`.

## Agent Rules

1. Use the Agent API for playback control: `/api/agent/*`.
2. Do not invent device IDs. Read `/api/devices` and target a real `device_id` or exact `device_name`.
3. If a response includes `warning: "Device appears offline (no active socket)"`, the command was emitted but no browser player is currently connected to that device room.
4. Deezer is metadata only. Soundsible never plays Deezer audio.
5. For playable search results outside the library, use YouTube / YouTube Music search through the ODST / yt-dlp path.
6. The playback queue is not the same as the download queue.
7. Prefer `/api/agent/play` for "play this now". Prefer `/api/playback/queue` for "add this to the player queue".

## Authentication

Agent endpoints require a Soundsible agent token.

Agent tokens are now stored in scoped `auth_tokens` records. Legacy `agent_tokens` compatibility still exists internally, but new integrations should treat the scoped token model as the source of truth.

Create a token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{"name":"openclaw"}'
```

If `SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN` is not configured, admin routes are allowed only from trusted LAN/Tailscale networks.

The response includes the raw token once:

```json
{
  "token": "raw-token-value",
  "token_id": "uuid",
  "name": "openclaw",
  "created_at": "2026-05-05 18:00:00"
}
```

Store the raw token in the agent secret store. Soundsible stores only a hash.

You can optionally request a narrower scope set when creating a token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{"name":"openclaw","scopes":["library:read","playback:control"]}'
```

Use one of these headers on protected agent routes:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>
X-Soundsible-Agent-Token: <agent-token>
```

Verify a token:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/agent/verify \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>'
```

## Mental Model

Soundsible has three independent concepts:

| Concept | Purpose | Important endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Library | Persistent downloaded/imported tracks and playlists | `GET /api/library` |
| Playback queue | In-memory queue consumed by the web player | `GET/POST /api/playback/queue` |
| Download queue | Background jobs that download tracks into the library | `POST /api/downloader/queue` |

The active player is normally a browser tab or PWA at `/player/` or `/player/desktop/`. The player registers a device and joins a Socket.IO room:

```text
playback:{scope}:{device_id}
```

Current scope is `default`.

Agent HTTP commands emit Socket.IO events into the target device room. If the target browser is not connected, Soundsible can accept the request but the device will not react.

## Devices

List devices:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/devices
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "dev-1775490811387-hu7wrzro8",
      "device_name": "Desktop",
      "device_type": "desktop",
      "scope": "default",
      "active_sid": "abc123",
      "socket_connected": true,
      "last_seen_ts": 1775490830.0
    }
  ]
}
```

How agents should choose a device:

1. Prefer a device with `active_sid` set.
2. Prefer `device_type != "agent"` for playback.
3. If the user says "Desktop", target the device whose `device_name` is exactly `Desktop`, or use its `device_id`.
4. If there are no devices with `active_sid`, tell the user to open Soundsible in a browser or PWA.

Register an agent device, optional but useful for discovery:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/devices/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"device_id":"openclaw-agent","device_name":"OpenClaw","device_type":"agent"}'
```

Browser players also register over Socket.IO. HTTP registration alone does not make a device controllable; `active_sid` is the signal that a real Socket.IO player is connected.

## Control Playback

Pause a target device:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/command \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"command":"pause","device_id":"Desktop"}'
```

Resume the current track on a target device:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/command \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"command":"play","device_id":"Desktop"}'
```

Skip to next:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/command \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"command":"next","device_id":"Desktop"}'
```

Seek to an absolute position in the current track:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/command \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"command":"seek","position_sec":75.5,"device_id":"Desktop"}'
```

Seek uses absolute seconds from the start of the current track. To seek to 1:15, send `position_sec: 75`. To jump forward or backward, first read `/api/playback/state`, add or subtract seconds from `position_sec`, then send the new absolute value.

Supported commands:

```json
{"command":"pause"}
{"command":"play"}
{"command":"next"}
{"command":"seek","position_sec":75.5}
```

For `seek`, `position_sec` is required and must be a number greater than or equal to `0`. `position_ms` is also accepted for millisecond-based clients. The target browser clamps positions beyond the loaded track duration to the end of the track.

If `device_id` is omitted, Soundsible targets the most recently registered non-agent device, preferring devices with an active socket.

## Play Music Now

Play a library track by ID:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/play \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"track_id":"<library-track-id>","device_id":"Desktop"}'
```

Play by search query:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/agent/play \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"Daft Punk One More Time","device_id":"Desktop"}'
```

Search behavior:

1. Soundsible searches the local library first.
2. If no library match is found, it searches YouTube Music through yt-dlp.
3. The target player receives either a library track payload or a preview payload.

Expected response when sent to a live device:

```json
{
  "status": "sent",
  "device_id": "dev-...",
  "track": {
    "id": "track-or-video-id",
    "title": "Track title",
    "artist": "Artist"
  }
}
```

If the device is registered but offline:

```json
{
  "status": "sent",
  "device_id": "dev-...",
  "warning": "Device appears offline (no active socket)"
}
```

Treat that as not actually played.

### Browser Autoplay Limitation

After a browser reload, the page may have no user activation. In that state, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox can reject audible `audio.play()` calls that originate from Socket.IO or HTTP-triggered agent commands.

Soundsible handles this by staging the remote request in the player. The target device shows a **Remote playback is ready** prompt with the requested track. One tap starts the staged playback and unlocks the browser audio session for later agent commands in that page session.

Agent behavior:

1. If `/api/agent/play` returns `status: "sent"` and the device has `active_sid`, the command reached the browser.
2. If playback does not audibly start immediately after a fresh reload, tell the user to tap the remote playback prompt on that device.
3. Once the user has started any audio in that page session, later agent playback, pause, resume, and next commands should work without this prompt.

This is a browser security policy, not a Soundsible API failure. To avoid the prompt completely, use a native playback surface or server-side playback engine instead of browser audio.

## Library

Get the full library:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/library
```

Search library:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/library/search?q=radiohead'
```

The library response includes persistent tracks. A normal track has a stable Soundsible `id`. Use that `id` for:

```json
{"track_id":"<id>"}
```

Useful library routes:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/library` | Full library metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/library/search?q=...` | Search local library |
| `GET` | `/api/library/albums?sort=&genre=&year=` | Albums from the normalized catalog. `sort` is one of `newest`, `alphabeticalByName`, `alphabeticalByArtist`, `byYear`, `byGenre`, `random`, `frequent`, `recent`, `highest`; an unknown one is a 400 |
| `GET` | `/api/library/albums/<album_id>` | One record and its track ids, in disc and track order |
| `GET` | `/api/library/artists` | Artists with a track to their name, from `track_artists` |
| `GET` | `/api/library/artists/<artist_id>` | One artist: the tracks they perform on, and the records they are credited with |
| `GET` | `/api/library/genres` | Genres present, with song and album counts |
| `GET` | `/api/library/years` | Release years present, with album and track counts |
| `POST` | `/api/library/scan` | Start an asynchronous scan of configured music roots; optional body `{"path":"..."}` must stay inside one |
| `GET` | `/api/library/scan` | Current or last scan state and counters |
| `GET` | `/api/library/favourites` | Favorite track IDs (only the ones you own a file for) |
| `GET` | `/api/library/favourites/entries` | All saved songs, downloaded or not: `{"version":2,"favourites":[{"keys":[...],"title","artist",...}]}` |
| `POST` | `/api/library/favourites/toggle` | Toggle favorite, body `{"track_id":"..."}` or `{"favourite":{"keys":["yt:<video_id>"],"title":"...","artist":"..."}}` |
| `POST` | `/api/library/playlists` | Create playlist, body `{"name":"..."}` |
| `POST` | `/api/library/playlists/<name>/tracks` | Add track to playlist, body `{"track_id":"..."}` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/library/playlists/<name>/tracks/<track_id>` | Remove track from playlist |

Mutation routes may require admin authorization or trusted LAN/Tailscale access.

Folder scans require `library:write`. A successful start returns HTTP `202`;
poll the `GET` route until `state` is `completed` or `failed`. Repeating the
start during `queued` or `scanning` returns the same `scan_id`. Scans are
additive: use the separate purge route when missing source files should be
removed from the catalog.

## Playback Queue

This is the queue the browser player consumes when the user or agent asks for "next".

Read queue:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/playback/queue
```

Add a library track:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/playback/queue \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"track_id":"<library-track-id>"}'
```

Add a YouTube preview item:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/playback/queue \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "preview": {
      "video_id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
      "title": "Example",
      "artist": "Artist",
      "duration": 213,
      "thumbnail": "https://..."
    }
  }'
```

Queue operations:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/playback/queue` | Queue contents |
| `POST` | `/api/playback/queue` | Add library track or preview |
| `DELETE` | `/api/playback/queue/<index>` | Remove by queue index |
| `DELETE` | `/api/playback/queue/track/<track_id>` | Remove all queue entries with ID |
| `POST` | `/api/playback/queue/move` | Body `{"from_index":0,"to_index":1}` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/playback/queue` | Clear queue |
| `GET` | `/api/playback/next` | Pop next item |
| `POST` | `/api/playback/repeat` | Body `{"mode":"off"|"all"|"one"|"once"}` |
| `POST` | `/api/playback/shuffle` | Shuffle current queue |

Important: `/api/playback/next` pops an item. Do not call it just to inspect the queue.

## Download Queue

This queue downloads audio into the persistent library. It is not the same as playback queue.

Use this endpoint only when the user wants to **download/import music into the library**:

```http
POST /api/downloader/queue
```

The request body is always an object with an `items` array:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "song_str": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not send a bare item object. Do not send a bare `video_id`. Do not use playback queue `preview` objects here.

Search YouTube / YouTube Music:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/youtube/search?q=Daft%20Punk%20One%20More%20Time&limit=5&source=ytmusic'
```

Valid `source` values:

```text
ytmusic
music
youtube
```

`source=ytmusic` and `source=music` search YouTube Music. `source=youtube` searches regular YouTube.

Peek a YouTube URL or ID, without queueing or downloading:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/youtube/peek?id=dQw4w9WgXcQ'
```

### Download Queue Item Formats

There are three supported music item shapes.

#### 1. Recommended: resolved YouTube / YouTube Music result

Use this when the agent has searched `/api/downloader/youtube/search` and selected a result. Send a full YouTube URL in `song_str` and include `video_id`.

If the search result has `webpage_url`, use it. If it only has an 11-character `id`, build:

```text
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/queue \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "source_type": "ytmusic_search",
        "song_str": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8",
        "video_id": "FGBhQbmPwH8",
        "display_title": "One More Time",
        "display_artist": "Daft Punk",
        "duration_sec": 320,
        "thumbnail_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FGBhQbmPwH8/mqdefault.jpg",
        "metadata_evidence": {
          "title": "One More Time",
          "artist": "Daft Punk",
          "album": "Discovery"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Use `source_type: "ytmusic_search"` for a result selected from YouTube Music search. Use `source_type: "youtube_search"` for a result selected from regular YouTube search. Use `source_type: "youtube_url"` for a user-provided YouTube URL.

Important: explicit YouTube source types require a YouTube URL in `song_str`. This is invalid:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "source_type": "ytmusic_search",
      "song_str": "Daft Punk One More Time"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. User-provided YouTube URL

Use this when the user gives a YouTube URL directly. `source_type` is optional because Soundsible can infer YouTube URLs, but including it is clearer.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/queue \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "source_type": "youtube_url",
        "song_str": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8",
        "video_id": "FGBhQbmPwH8"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Do not send only the video id:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "video_id": "FGBhQbmPwH8"
    }
  ]
}
```

That is rejected because the downloader needs `song_str` to say what to download.

#### 3. Plain text fallback

Use this only when the agent has no resolved YouTube result yet and wants Soundsible to search during processing. Do not set `source_type`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/queue \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "song_str": "Daft Punk - One More Time",
        "metadata_evidence": {
          "title": "One More Time",
          "artist": "Daft Punk"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This path is less precise. For agent workflows, prefer searching first, selecting a result, then queueing the resolved URL format.

### Accepted Response

Successful queueing returns accepted item IDs:

```json
{
  "status": "queued",
  "ids": ["download-job-id"],
  "accepted": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "id": "download-job-id",
      "source_type": "ytmusic_search"
    }
  ],
  "rejected": []
}
```

Partial failure is possible. Always inspect both `accepted` and `rejected`.

Common rejected reasons:

| Reason | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No JSON data received` | Body was empty or not JSON | Send `Content-Type: application/json` and a JSON object |
| `Item must be an object` | An `items` entry was not an object | Put objects inside `items` |
| `Missing source_type/song_str` | No usable input | Include `song_str` |
| `Invalid or unsupported YouTube URL or missing video_id` | Explicit YouTube source type had no full YouTube URL/video id | Send full URL in `song_str` and `video_id` |
| `Playlist-only or invalid YouTube URL (missing v=)` | URL is not a single video URL | Pick a specific video |
| `This link type is not supported` | Spotify link or unsupported source | Resolve through YouTube Music first |

Start processing:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/start \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SOUNDSIBLE_ADMIN_TOKEN>'
```

Check download queue:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/downloader/queue/status
```

When downloads finish, Soundsible emits `library_updated` and the track appears in `/api/library`.

### Agent Decision Rules for Downloads

1. If the user says "download this YouTube link", queue `source_type: "youtube_url"` with `song_str` as the full URL.
2. If the user says "download Song by Artist", first call `/api/downloader/youtube/search?source=ytmusic`, pick the best result, then queue the resolved URL format.
3. If search is unavailable or inconclusive, queue plain text with only `song_str` and optional `metadata_evidence`; do not add `source_type`.
4. Never use Deezer IDs, Spotify URLs, playback queue preview objects, or raw `video_id`-only payloads for `/api/downloader/queue`.
5. After queueing, call `/api/downloader/start`; queueing alone does not begin processing.

## Deezer Discovery

Deezer routes are metadata only.

Allowed proxy paths:

```text
chart
search
playlist/<numeric-id>
track/<numeric-id>
artist/<numeric-id>/top
```

Examples:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/discovery/deezer/search?q=daft%20punk'
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/discovery/deezer/chart'
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/discovery/deezer/playlist/3155776842'
```

Deezer track IDs are not playable Soundsible track IDs. A Deezer row is a metadata suggestion. To play it:

1. Extract `title` and `artist.name` from the Deezer response.
2. Search YouTube Music: `/api/downloader/youtube/search?q=<artist title>&source=ytmusic`.
3. Pick the best result.
4. Either:
   - play now with `/api/agent/play` using the query, or
   - add a preview item to `/api/playback/queue`, or
   - add it to `/api/downloader/queue` to download it into the library.

Do not call `/api/agent/play` with `track_id: "deezer_123"` or a raw Deezer numeric ID.

## Playback State, Resume, and Handoff

Players periodically write state:

```http
PUT /api/playback/state
```

State includes:

```json
{
  "track_id": "track-or-video-id",
  "position_sec": 42.5,
  "is_playing": true,
  "device_id": "dev-...",
  "device_name": "Desktop",
  "device_type": "desktop"
}
```

Players may also publish a `session` object alongside it — the queue, the
transport preferences and the Auto Mode workspace behind the song — which is
what lets another device pick the session up rather than just the track. It is a
delta: omit the key and whatever is stored for that device is kept, send `null`
to end it. Agents have no reason to write one, and an agent that starts an
unrelated song on a device should send `"session": null` so the device does not
restore a queue that track is not in. Sessions over 256 KB are dropped.

Read state:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/playback/state
```

Read state from another device, excluding the current device:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:5005/api/playback/state?exclude_device=<device-id>'
```

Move playback from one device to another:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/api/playback/handoff \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"from_device_id":"dev-phone","to_device_id":"dev-desktop"}'
```

Handoff behavior:

1. Reads state from `from_device_id`.
2. Emits `playback_stop_requested` to `playback:default:<from_device_id>`.
3. Writes target playback state with `to_device_id`.
4. Emits `playback_start_requested` to `playback:default:<to_device_id>`.

If `to_device_id` has no active socket, the response includes an offline warning.

Seek behavior:

1. `POST /api/agent/command` with `{"command":"seek","position_sec":...}` reads the target device playback state.
2. The API writes the requested `position_sec` into playback state.
3. The API emits `playback_seek_requested` to `playback:default:<device_id>`.
4. The browser player sets `audio.currentTime` and persists the new position.

If the target has no current playback state, the API returns `404` with `No playback state available for target device`.

## Podcasts

Podcast discovery and playback is separate from music search.

Useful routes:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/discovery/podcasts/search?q=...` | Search podcast directory |
| `GET` | `/api/discovery/podcasts/top?country=US&limit=25` | Top podcasts |
| `GET` | `/api/podcasts/subscriptions` | Subscribed feeds |
| `POST` | `/api/podcasts/subscribe` | Subscribe by feed data |
| `GET` | `/api/podcasts/feeds/<feed_id>/episodes` | Episodes for a feed |
| `POST` | `/api/podcasts/enclosure/peek` | Create a stream token for an enclosure |
| `GET` | `/api/podcasts/stream/<token>` | Stream podcast audio |

Podcast preview queue items use `enclosure_url`, not `video_id`.

## Recommended Agent Skill Flow

For "play X on my desktop":

1. Verify token with `GET /api/agent/verify`.
2. Read devices with `GET /api/devices`.
3. Select `Desktop` with `active_sid`; if missing, ask the user to open `/player/desktop/`.
4. Call `POST /api/agent/play` with `{"query":"X","device_id":"Desktop"}`.
5. If the response has `warning`, report that the device is offline.

For "add X to the queue":

1. Search local library: `GET /api/library/search?q=X`.
2. If a good library match exists, `POST /api/playback/queue` with `{"track_id":"..."}`.
3. If not, search YouTube Music with `/api/downloader/youtube/search`.
4. Add the chosen result as `{"preview": {...}}`.

For "seek to 1:15" or "jump to 75 seconds":

1. Read devices with `GET /api/devices` and target an active browser player.
2. Send `POST /api/agent/command` with `{"command":"seek","position_sec":75,"device_id":"Desktop"}`.
3. For relative seeking, read `/api/playback/state`, compute the new absolute position, then send `seek`.

For "download X":

1. Search YouTube Music: `GET /api/downloader/youtube/search?q=X&source=ytmusic&limit=5`.
2. Pick the best result. Use `webpage_url` as `song_str`; if missing, build `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>`.
3. Queue it with `POST /api/downloader/queue` as `{"items":[{"source_type":"ytmusic_search","song_str":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>","video_id":"<id>","display_title":"...","display_artist":"..."}]}`.
4. Start processing with `POST /api/downloader/start`.
5. Poll `/api/downloader/queue/status`.
6. Refresh library after completion.

For "download this YouTube URL":

1. Queue it with `POST /api/downloader/queue` as `{"items":[{"source_type":"youtube_url","song_str":"<full-youtube-url>"}]}`.
2. Start processing with `POST /api/downloader/start`.

For "play this Deezer track":

1. Treat Deezer as metadata only.
2. Search YouTube Music for `artist + title`.
3. Play the YouTube Music match or add it as preview.

## Troubleshooting

Check device/socket state:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5005/api/agent/debug/socketio \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <agent-token>'
```

Common problems:

| Symptom | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `warning: Device appears offline` | Device is registered but has no active Socket.IO room join | Open/reload the player on that device |
| `Target device not found` | Agent used an unknown device ID/name | Call `/api/devices` and target a real device |
| Command returns `sent` but nothing plays | Usually no active socket or browser autoplay blocked | Check `active_sid`; after reload, tap the remote playback prompt once |
| Seek returns `seek requires position_sec` | Agent sent `seek` without an absolute position | Send `{"command":"seek","position_sec":75}` |
| Seek returns no playback state | Target device has not reported a current track | Start playback first or target the active device from `/api/devices` |
| Deezer ID fails | Deezer IDs are metadata only | Resolve by title/artist through YouTube Music |
| `/api/playback/next` changed queue | It pops the next item | Use `GET /api/playback/queue` to inspect |
| Download queue rejects raw `video_id` | `/api/downloader/queue` requires `items[].song_str` | Send full YouTube URL in `song_str` plus `video_id` |
| Download queue rejects `ytmusic_search` with plain text | Explicit YouTube source types require resolved YouTube URLs | Search first, then queue the selected result URL; or omit `source_type` for plain text fallback |
| Downloaded song not visible | Download job not finished or library not synced | Check `/api/downloader/queue/status`, then `/api/library/sync` if needed |
