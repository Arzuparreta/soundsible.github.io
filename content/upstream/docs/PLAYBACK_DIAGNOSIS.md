# Automatic iPhone / car playback evidence

Status: diagnostic implementation, **not a verified fix**. Collection is automatic and passive; transport behavior is unchanged. Neither a successful `play()` nor `playbackState=playing`
proves what Now Playing, CarPlay or the head unit displays, or that sound reaches
the speakers. Device acceptance is still required.

## Evidence and hypothesis

The September 8 trip window (21:30–23:00 Europe/Madrid) contains 325 server
telemetry records, including 14 completed PWA handoffs. All handoff projections
declare playing with source and carrier active. At 22:27:27 an inactive source
play was rejected; at 22:30:45 a handoff completed, followed by in-app pause and
resume at 22:30:48–49. These are server receipt times, not client execution times.
The inactive-play event's `media_session` origin is inferred by the existing
code, not proof of a remote command.

The source deck being retired is paused but left unmuted; preload and volume
operations also leave idle elements unmuted. WebKit can select one of these
elements for platform controls even though the mixed carrier stays playing.
Its candidate comparator includes user-interaction recency; it does not always
prefer the playing element. Metadata and the selected element's playing state
can therefore disagree. This is a hypothesis about this incident, not proof
that the inspected WebKit revision matches the affected phone.

## Listener workflow

Play music normally. No settings, experiment selection, markers, export, or
computer connection is required. Collection begins after authentication when the
player loads. The running server must contain the trace endpoint and the player
must have loaded these sources; an already-open old page cannot be instrumented
retroactively. A normal subsequent opening loads the current player.

## Automatic collection and delivery

- Each page session has a random capture ID, source fingerprint, existing device
  ID, client start time and strictly increasing sequence with monotonic elapsed
  milliseconds. The iOS version is inferred from the user agent and explicitly
  marked as reported, not an exact verified OS build. Connection type and the
  car's display are not exposed to the web app and are not invented.
- Records cover source/carrier native media events, source changes, play promise
  outcomes, pause/load calls, context state, gesture unlock, transport origin,
  retirement, and Media Session before/after publication. Snapshots include all
  observed elements, mute/paused/readiness/position, source category, mix state,
  gain targets, and local volume. No media URLs, names, artwork or audio.
- Healthy time updates are sampled every five seconds per element; for ten
  seconds around a handoff they are sampled up to four times per second. Native
  pause/play/load/error events are not sampled away. Background execution can
  be suspended by iOS; the recorder does not claim a timer always runs.
- Events are batched and committed to IndexedDB within one second (or when a
  batch fills), sent every five seconds and on lifecycle/online events. Requests
  use keepalive and bounded bodies. An unacknowledged batch survives reloads and
  is retried with backoff. Delivery order can differ from execution order; the
  report uses capture ID and sequence, not receipt time.
- The server commits each batch in an account-local SQLite database before
  acknowledgement. Batch IDs deduplicate retries. A mismatched authenticated
  account is rejected. Browser outboxes are also partitioned by account.
- The browser prunes its outbox to 16 MiB / 8,192 batches / seven days on each
  delivery cycle (normally five seconds, including offline cycles); the server
  retains at most 64 MiB of payload / 32,768 batches for seven days, whichever
  limit is reached first. SQLite may occupy additional space for indexes and
  reusable pages. Browser storage refusal falls back to bounded memory; a sudden
  process kill may lose events not yet committed. Loss counters and sequence
  gaps are evidence limitations, not successful delivery.
- `SOUNDSIBLE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` disables server storage and the acknowledgement
  stops this page's recorder, clearing its pending account outbox.

## Operator analysis (the listener does not run this)

The authenticated user's server directory contains
`telemetry/playback-traces.sqlite3`. The agent can read it directly:

```sh
python scripts/playback_trace_report.py /path/to/user/telemetry/playback-traces.sqlite3 --since 2026-09-08T21:30:00+02:00
```

The report groups captures/device/revision, prints loss and sequence gaps, and
extracts two seconds before / ten seconds after handoffs and transport commands.
It also identifies declared non-playing state while media position advances.
That flag is an observation for investigation: seeking or an inactive source can
also advance position. It is not proof of the car's state or audible output.

A raw inactive-element `play` without a preceding application `call.play` or
`media_session.action` is distinguishable from an app-issued operation. It does
not by itself identify the origin as the car. Unlock samples are distinguished
from real source tracks and the mixed stream. Correlate the outgoing source's
pause/unload and the incoming/carrier progression with subsequent commands and
recovery; never interpret a read-back of `playbackState` as OS acknowledgement.

## Validation boundaries

Unit/backend tests cover observation ordering, original promise behavior,
privacy filtering, validation, durability, deduplication, account mismatch,
storage failure and retention. Browser tests cover automatic startup, IndexedDB
retry across reloads, account separation, and telemetry opt-out. These do not
reproduce iPhone/Toyota arbitration. The historical trip cannot be reconstructed
at this detail from the older server logs. No physical-device fix is claimed.
