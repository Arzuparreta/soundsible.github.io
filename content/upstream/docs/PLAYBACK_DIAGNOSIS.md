# Automatic iPhone / car playback evidence

Status: candidate iOS output and source-retirement correction, **not a device-verified fix**. Collection remains automatic. Neither a successful `play()` nor `playbackState=playing`
proves what Now Playing, CarPlay or the head unit displays, or that sound reaches
the speakers. Device acceptance is still required.

## September 29: podcast skip on iPhone PWA

The listener reports that +/-15-second taps briefly replay or loop the previous
audio buffer before the requested position becomes audible; desktop PWA seeks
feel immediate. The roughly 100 ms duration is a listening estimate, not a trace.
The inspected seek path assigned `currentTime` without gating programme output.
[WebKit bug 288879](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288879) documents a
similar stale-buffer symptom through MediaElementAudioSourceNode and was fixed
upstream in March 2025. It is precedent, not proof of the cause on this device.

The candidate change gates the selected deck before assigning `currentTime`,
then restores its existing gain only after `seeked`, `seeking=false`, and
`readyState >= HAVE_FUTURE_DATA`. It leaves source playback and context running;
there is no fixed delay, resource reload, suspend/resume, or deferred `play()`.
The gate applies through the existing mix gain (including Live) and through
native mute when no graph is available. Source replacement, release, media error,
and ineffective seeks clear it. A user pause remains paused on completion.

Unit tests cover readiness/event ordering, repeated taps, mute/volume changes,
source replacement, no-op seeks and pause precedence. The podcast browser test
also seeks while playing and checks that the media clock continues, alongside
the existing paused seeks and saved-progress cases. Its silent WAV cannot prove
that old decoded samples are absent from physical iPhone output. In particular,
a WebKit buffer retained *after* its readiness declarations could outlive this
gate; do not call the acoustic symptom resolved without listening acceptance.

On the affected iPhone PWA, repeat forward/backward and consecutive taps while
playing, both within buffered audio and into an unbuffered position. Expect
silence while seeking rather than repeated old audio, then the requested
position. Check a paused seek, pause during buffering, change episode during a
seek, and the actual speaker/headphone/Bluetooth route used for the report.

## September 19: lock regression and rejected reconnect corrections

The listener reports Safari PWA on the same iPhone with wired CarPlay. During
11:00–12:20 Europe/Madrid on September 19, locking stopped sound immediately;
Play did not reliably restore it. Disconnecting while locked could still cause
music to resume after unlocking outside the car. Reconnecting could still leave
playback advancing without sound. The listener therefore rejects both #197 and
#210 as verified fixes for the disconnect/reconnect problems.

Seven received captures contain 3,316 events, no sequence gaps and no reported
loss. There are 19 context-state changes immediately followed by programme pause,
and 14 `needs_play` recovery failures. At 11:19:30, 11:19:37 and 12:05:38 a context
`interrupted` event causes the app to pause before visibility becomes hidden,
without a preceding Media Session Pause in those sequences. At 11:51 and 11:58,
Play attempts time out while the context remains interrupted. These observations
establish application behavior, not physical route or acoustic output.

The captures identify client fingerprint
`57eddd9e99a012d76773eeebf72c3bf04691ea32b6bc97681137f50a2f85ac47`.
It differs from the inspected current source tree; it has not been mapped to an
exact git revision. The immediate context-to-pause rule and mandatory iOS Play
renewal are present in the merged #210 code. Do not label the captured client as
a proven exact checkout of that commit.

### Candidate correction, pending physical acceptance

A context-only interruption no longer revokes playback intent. Locking can
interrupt Web Audio before visibility changes, so visibility is not used to
classify it as a cable disconnect. With playback still requested, context state
changes and page restoration request `resume()` without pausing or restarting
the source. Requests are coalesced, report their outcome, and time out after five
seconds of executable JavaScript; a timeout does not schedule another attempt.
A later event or explicit Play can retry. An initial pending source start is not
mistaken for a native pause during page restoration.

Explicit UI and Media Session pauses and native participant pauses still revoke
intent. Generic gestures and page return cannot lift that pause. Native pauses
are recorded with `platform` origin; clock-recovery failures use `recovery`, not
a fabricated UI or Media Session command. These are additive internal transport
origins using the existing telemetry envelope and field allowlist.

Play requests context and source activation in the same turn, without an
unconditional suspend/resume cycle or waiting for the context clock first.
Where supported, the player requests `navigator.audioSession.type = 'playback'`
before activation. Missing or rejected Audio Session support is tolerated.
This is an explicit music-session hint described by the
[Audio Session draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/audio-session/), not acoustic proof.

The existing one-shot suspend/resume recovery is retained only for the measured
frozen-clock failure: the source progresses while the running context clock
stays still across continuous observations. Observation gaps, source changes and
seeks reset the measurement. It preserves the graph and Live tap; cancellation
and its five-second deadline remain in place. Musical silence is not a trigger.
There is no automatic detector for a lost route with both clocks advancing;
`healthy` only describes internal checks, never confirmed sound in the car.

### Acceptance

Automated cases cover lock event ordering, repeated lock/unlock, restoration
while Play is pending, explicit pause precedence, late resume completion,
coalescing and timeouts, optional Audio Session support, source identity, Live,
and the existing frozen-clock recovery and DJ ownership cases.

On the affected iPhone/PWA with wired CarPlay, repeat for NORMAL and DJ:

1. Play for at least ten minutes locked, including automatic and manual song
   changes. Lock/unlock repeatedly. Sound must continue without another Play.
2. Disconnect while playing and locked; unlock outside the car. Record whether
   sound resumes unexpectedly. Explicit pauses must remain respected.
3. Reconnect, then press Play from the car and separately from the phone. Sound
   must return through the car without reloading the page, at the retained song
   position. Repeat with the car unit on and off and different disconnect order.
4. Pause or change song during a pending recovery and during a DJ transition.
   Old work must not revive the previous song; volume and Live must be preserved.

Lock continuity and audible reconnection require device acceptance. A remaining
spontaneous resume on disconnect is a separate lower-priority issue: do not
restore blanket context-to-pause rules to suppress it. Browser tests cannot
identify a physical disconnect or establish speaker output.

## Evidence and hypothesis

The September 9 trip confirmed by the listener (21:14–21:20 Europe/Madrid)
has 548 received events, no internal sequence gaps and no reported loss. All
recorded media rates are one. At 21:17:34, pausing the outgoing source changes
the observed Media Session declaration from playing to paused; the incoming
source and carrier keep playing. The application republishes playing about
41 ms later. This measures browser observations, not the head unit's delay.

During 33 stable foreground intervals, the context/wall clock median is
0.996618, while source and carrier positions advance at approximately one
second per second. Two other iPhone sessions and desktop sessions have medians
near one. The listener reports normal sound outside the car; the browser does
not identify the physical output route.

WebKit's [AudioSampleDataConverter](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/ca3a9f205bcecd15c9d2ed0680acc25b56785109/Source/WebCore/platform/audio/cocoa/AudioSampleDataConverter.mm)
adapts a low buffer with 1.05 output resampling, entering at 20 ms and leaving
above 60 ms. With the observed clock ratio, a simplified buffer model predicts
11.8 seconds of normal playback and 0.86 seconds of correction. This closely
matches the reported periodic slowdown/pitch drop, but does not establish the
exact WebKit build or converter activity on the phone.

The candidate removes the MediaStream carrier from iOS/iPadOS device output:
the mixed monitor connects directly to the AudioContext destination. The
reported mode is `direct`, distinct from a carrier failure's `direct_fallback`.
Gestures cannot switch intentional direct output back to the carrier. The Live
stream tap remains independent, upstream of local volume and mute. Other
platforms retain their carrier path.

Source eligibility is tracked independently of gain: empty, staged and retired
decks stay muted; an incoming deck is unmuted before play, including zero-gain
preroll. Both sources participate during a blend. Retirement mutes before
pausing, while the canonical paused source remains eligible for resume. Volume
changes and completion of an old unlock sample cannot unmute an idle source.
Settled source operations and inactive native events trigger a coalesced
microtask publication of canonical state, including in the background. This
does not issue play commands or claim ownership of iOS's selected element.

Physical acceptance requires matched songs on the same iPhone/car: at least
five minutes of steady playback without periodic pitch dips, multiple automatic
and manual transitions in foreground and with the screen locked, car pause/play,
and correct title/state without unlocking. Compare the reference and candidate;
do not equate an improved clock ratio or passing tests with audible acceptance.

### Earlier evidence

The September 8 trip window (21:30–23:00 Europe/Madrid) contains 325 server
telemetry records, including 14 completed PWA handoffs. All handoff projections
declare playing with source and carrier active. At 22:27:27 an inactive source
play was rejected; at 22:30:45 a handoff completed, followed by in-app pause and
resume at 22:30:48–49. These are server receipt times, not client execution times.
The inactive-play event's `media_session` origin is inferred by the existing
code, not proof of a remote command.

Before this correction the source being retired was paused but left unmuted;
preload and volume operations also left idle elements unmuted. WebKit can select one of these
elements for platform controls even though the mixed carrier stays playing.
Its candidate comparator includes user-interaction recency; it does not always
prefer the playing element. Metadata and the selected element's playing state
can therefore disagree. This is a hypothesis about this incident, not proof
that the inspected WebKit revision matches the affected phone.

## Listener workflow

Play music normally. No settings, experiment selection, markers, export, or
computer connection is required. Collection begins after authentication when the
player loads. The running server must contain the trace endpoint and the player
must have loaded these sources; an already-open old page cannot be instrumented
retroactively. A normal subsequent opening loads the current player.

## Automatic collection and delivery

- Each page session has a random capture ID, source fingerprint, existing device
  ID, client start time and strictly increasing sequence with monotonic elapsed
  milliseconds. The iOS version is inferred from the user agent and explicitly
  marked as reported, not an exact verified OS build. Connection type and the
  car's display are not exposed to the web app and are not invented.
- Records cover source/carrier native media events, source changes, play promise
  outcomes, pause/load calls, context state, gesture unlock, transport origin,
  retirement, and Media Session before/after publication. Snapshots include all
  observed elements, mute/paused/readiness/position, source category, mix state,
  gain targets, and local volume. No media URLs, names, artwork or audio.
- Healthy time updates are sampled every five seconds per element; for ten
  seconds around a handoff they are sampled up to four times per second. Native
  pause/play/load/error events are not sampled away. Background execution can
  be suspended by iOS; the recorder does not claim a timer always runs.
- Events are batched and committed to IndexedDB within one second (or when a
  batch fills), sent every five seconds and on lifecycle/online events. Requests
  use keepalive and bounded bodies. An unacknowledged batch survives reloads and
  is retried with backoff. Delivery order can differ from execution order; the
  report uses capture ID and sequence, not receipt time.
- The server commits each batch in an account-local SQLite database before
  acknowledgement. Batch IDs deduplicate retries. A mismatched authenticated
  account is rejected. Browser outboxes are also partitioned by account.
- The browser prunes its outbox to 16 MiB / 8,192 batches / seven days on each
  delivery cycle (normally five seconds, including offline cycles); the server
  retains at most 64 MiB of payload / 32,768 batches for seven days, whichever
  limit is reached first. SQLite may occupy additional space for indexes and
  reusable pages. Browser storage refusal falls back to bounded memory; a sudden
  process kill may lose events not yet committed. Loss counters and sequence
  gaps are evidence limitations, not successful delivery.
- `SOUNDSIBLE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` disables server storage and the acknowledgement
  stops this page's recorder, clearing its pending account outbox.

## Operator analysis (the listener does not run this)

The authenticated user's server directory contains
`telemetry/playback-traces.sqlite3`. The agent can read it directly:

```sh
python scripts/playback_trace_report.py /path/to/user/telemetry/playback-traces.sqlite3 --since 2026-09-08T21:30:00+02:00
```

The report groups captures/device/revision, prints loss and sequence gaps, and
extracts two seconds before / ten seconds after handoffs and transport commands.
It also compares context and source clocks against client monotonic time in
stable intervals, grouped by output mode and visibility. It excludes observed
transport operations, pauses, seeks, rate changes, transitions and sequence
gaps. At least three usable intervals are required; a clock ratio is not a
measurement of audible pitch. This works with both direct and carrier output.
It also identifies declared non-playing state while media position advances.
That flag is an observation for investigation: seeking or an inactive source can
also advance position. It is not proof of the car's state or audible output.

A raw inactive-element `play` without a preceding application `call.play` or
`media_session.action` is distinguishable from an app-issued operation. It does
not by itself identify the origin as the car. Unlock samples are distinguished
from real source tracks and the mixed stream. Correlate the outgoing source's
pause/unload and the incoming/carrier progression with subsequent commands and
recovery; never interpret a read-back of `playbackState` as OS acknowledgement.

## Validation boundaries

Unit/backend tests cover observation ordering, original promise behavior,
privacy filtering, validation, durability, deduplication, account mismatch,
storage failure and retention. Browser tests cover automatic startup, IndexedDB
retry across reloads, account separation, and telemetry opt-out. These do not
reproduce iPhone/Toyota arbitration. The historical trip cannot be reconstructed
at this detail from the older server logs. No physical-device fix is claimed.
